### Spidertron remote pipette

Press `Shift + Q` whilst hovering your cursor over a spidertron to select a remote from your inventory connected to that spidertron.

### Open vehicle inventories directly
Press `Shift + E` whilst in a vehicle (not just a spidertron!) to open its inventory.

### Spidertron inventory sort

Spidertron inventories are automatically sorted just like the player's.

### No item loss

A spidertron's items are spilled on the ground instead of being lost when it dies.

## Known Bugs / Limitations

- Spidertron equipment grids and logistics cannot function whilst the spidertron is not active
- Compatibility with [Spidertron Weapon Switcher](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronWeaponSwitcher) is a little unstable. It will work for the vast majority of the time, but there is the possibility of a crash, so please ensure that you are saving regularly if using these mods together. Ammo placed in an inactive weapon's slots will be lost when you enter a vehicle or quick toggle with a spidertron from this mod.
