# Spidertron Enhancements

Some simple features to make your life easier whilst using a spidertron. All features can be turned on or off individually.

### Enter vehicles from spidertron

Press `Enter` near a vehicle whilst riding a spidertron to enter the vehicle.

### Spidertron remote pathfinder

`Alt + Click` with the spidertron remote to use the pathfinder to automatically navigate around water.

### Recall last used spidertron

Press `Alt + C` or click on the shortcut to call your most recently driven spidertron to you.

### Spidertron remote pipette

Press `Shift + Q` whilst hovering your cursor over a spidertron to select a remote from your inventory connected to that spidertron. If no connected remotes are found then an unconnected remote will be selected and connected (you can turn this off in **Per player** settings).
If you aren't hovering your cursor over a spidertron, it will pick a remote connected to the spidertron you are driving.

Alternatively, there is a **Map** setting that enables picking a temporary remote without requiring you to have any remotes in your inventory.

### Open vehicle inventories directly

Press `Shift + E` whilst holding a spidertron remote to open the inventory of the connected spidertron. If not holding a remote, it will open the inventory of the vehicle (not just a spidertron!) you are driving.
Spidertron inventories will never be forcibly closed, no matter how far away the spidertron becomes from the player.

### Spidertron inventory sort

Spidertron inventories are automatically sorted just like the player's.

### Spidertron corpse with inventory

Spidertron inventories are saved into a corpse instead of being lost when it dies.

### Configure spidertron sounds

Spidertron volume and sound play frequency can be changed in settings. Default values are the same as when playing without this mod. Affects modded spidertrons as well.

## Known Bugs / Limitations

- Spidertron equipment grids and logistics cannot function whilst the spidertron is 'inside' the player
- When a spidertron enters a vehicle or is quick-toggled, any remotes connected to it that are stored in an inventory more than 30 tiles from a player will become disconnected
- Compatibility with [Spidertron Weapon Switcher](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronWeaponSwitcher) is a little unstable. Ammo in an inactive weapon's slots will be lost when you enter a vehicle or quick toggle with a spidertron from this mod.
