Features
-----

- Enter a train or other vehicle without leaving the spidertron
    - Press *Enter* or *U* near a vehicle whilst riding a spidertron to fit the spidertron inside it
- Quick exiting of spidertrons
    - Press *U* to exit or re-enter the spidertron
- Press *Shift + Q* whilst hovering your cursor over a spidertron to select a remote from your inventory connected to that spidertron
- Press *Shift + E* whilst in a vehicle (not just a spidertron!) to open its inventory
- Spidertron inventories are automatically sorted the same as the player's
- A spidertron's items are spilled on the ground when it dies instead of being deleted

Known Bugs / Limitations
-----

- Spidertron equipment grids and logistics cannot function whilst the spidertron is not active
- Compatibility with [Spidertron Weapon Switcher](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronWeaponSwitcher) is a little unstable. It will work for the vast majority of the time, but there is the definite possibility of a crash, so please ensure that you are saving regularly if using these mods together.
